Welcome to the Floating Sandbox Multimod Installer, this installer is designed to package all the mods in the Floating Sandbox: Designer's Studio Discord Server into one simple installer for ease of use.

If you have not used this installer before or are having issues, it's recommended you read this first.

After clicking "Next", you will be shown an installation path that will dictate where the mod files are meant to go. You should only change this if you changed the installation path of Floating Sandbox itself when you installed Floating Sandbox. If you have changed the installation path, make sure to set it to the 'Floating Sandbox' folder where your floatingsandbox.exe application file is.

After choosing your installation path, you will be shown a list of components, or mods, to install. The top, primary checkboxes dictate whether or not you are going to make any changes to that aspect, be it materials, smoke, or tools. If enabled, you may either install a mod or install the vanilla files - in the event you either don't want a mod or want to uninstall a mod, choose the vanilla files.

After choosing what mods to install, you will be prompted with a confirmation page, then the Multimod Installer will start, well, installing the mods, and you should be good to go after that.

If you have any issues or problems, make a bug report forum post in the Floating Sandbox Designer's Studio Discord server, or message Longhorn via 'looonghorn' on Discord.

Enjoy!
