# Floating Sandbox Extra Materials Mod v4

It's here.

**ADDED:**
- Alternate Wrought Iron Materials
- Alternate Low-Alloy Steel Materials
- Alternate Titanium Alloy Materials
- More Longleaf Pine & Chestnut Oak Colours
- Magic Rope Materials
	- This is meant to be a stiffer version of the rope material. With that said, this will only be all that apparent with at least 2x2 rope, so it's not all that much better. It *is* made of hull so won't flood pixels that aren't hull, so there is that.
- Alternate Rope & Alternate Magic Rope Materials
- Buff Steel Materials
	- This is meant to replicate the colours of certain companies whose funnel buff colours aren't necessarily represented well in base Floating Sandbox. Currently it includes an 1870-1919, 1920-1940, and 1949-1960 White Star Line buff, two Cunard Orange buffs from the 1910s and 1950s respectively (along with a 2024 Queen Mary red buff), a CGT buff from the 1930s, the United States Line buff, two North German Lloyd buffs from the 1900s and 1930s respectively, and the British Royal Navy hospital ship buff from the 1910s. Multiple buff colours are listed by time period oldest-to-newest in the shipbuilder.
	- All Buff Steel colours are provided by our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
- Diamond Materials
- Travertine Materials
- Marble Materials
- Alternate Sodium, Alternate Sodium Light & Alternate Sodium Very Light Materials
- Extra Alternate Cloth Materials
	- Based on real flag colours to hopefully encourage more accurate-looking flags.
- Alternate Extra Carbon Materials
- Alternate Metal Category
- Alternate Wood Category
- Modded Rope Category

**CHANGED:**
- Birch changed to Alternate Longleaf Pine
- Magnesium changed to Alternate Aluminum Alloy
- Refined a *lot* of material names to be more consistent, honestly don't have a complete record of everything as some of the changes I did without recording them down.
- Replaced Gasoline, Ice, Metal Alloy & Nuclear Material material textures to textures under Creative Commons, provided by Freepik & SWTEXTURE.

**REMOVED:**
- ChatGPT-influenced physical properties on custom materials (Birch & Magnesium), yeah. Not particularly a fan of what I did in previous times. Ships with either of these two materials will have changed in density, strength, etc. as a result of this.

**KNOWN BUGS:**
- Gasoline ignites when in contact with water. I don't think there is anything I can do about this, but if I or someone else does find a way then the fix will be implemented. Additionally, gasoline will not ignite properly when it is only one pixel in width or height. It is recommended for all your gasoline to be at least 2 pixels in both width and height for the ideal Gasoline Experience™️.
Uranium 235 and Plutonium 239 are quite buggy when there are multiple other explosives onboard a ship. If there are two instances of either Uranium or Plutonium and one ignites, the game will force-close. Most of the time you should be fine with other non-atomic explosives, but your crash-free safety is not guaranteed. You have been warned.
- Opening the material palette in the shipbuilder can sometimes temporarily freeze Floating Sandbox. M2L has found this MIGHT happen when another program, such as Roblox, is open. If you experience this, try closing other programs you have open.
